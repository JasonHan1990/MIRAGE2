# MIRAGE 
######PureDigital Version

Mirage is a maze game that played with different dimensions and perspectives. 
The most significant rule and idea of this game-like experience is the different dimensional views. In order to win, players need to use dimension as a tool to switch between 2D and 3D so that they are able to pass through the complicated maze map.

The game is programmed with processing.
If you don`t have processing on your labtop, you can download the game [here.](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5FurjrK0xuOfmRhQUtYdnV6TEF5ZjE5M0FnY29KWU5lLXNzbldwbElUb3AzWkdOSVJVckE&usp=sharing)
