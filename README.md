Mirage is a maze game that played with different dimensions and perspectives. 
The most significant rule and idea of this game-like experience is the different dimensional views. In order to win, players need to use dimension as a tool to switch between 2D and 3D so that they are able to pass through the complicated maze map.

The game is programmed with processing. You can download the exported game here: [Windows](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5FurjrK0xuOfmRhQUtYdnV6TEF5ZjE5M0FnY29KWU5lLXNzbldwbElUb3AzWkdOSVJVckE&usp=sharing)
